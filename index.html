	<blockquote>"The brain behind several of the world's most notorious heists, you are a tactical genius and master planner. But after a recent botched job that landed you a stay in prison, rumor is you've lost your touch. A gambler at heart, and a damn good one at that, you're willing to put everything on the line to prove you still have what it takes."</blockquote>

	<H3>The Detective</H3>
	<blockquote>"As a private investigator, you've spent countless late nights spying, tailing, infiltrating... <em>anything</em> to uncover the truth. But that curiosity lead you to uncover secrets that some very powerful people had every intention of keeping buried. Now you have ten days to deliver $10,000,000 in reparations... or face the consequences."</blockquote>
	<h4>Traits</h4>
	<p class="reminder">Your strengths, weaknesses, skills, habits, and quirks.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Paranoid:</b><span> </span></li>
		<li><b>Curious to a fault:</b><span> </span></li>
		<li><b>Gives pseudonyms:</b><span> You <em>always</em> give a fake name. The problem is, you're no good at making up names, and they often come off as obviously made up...</span></li>
		<li><b>Never leaves a trace:</b><span> You've worked enough crime scenes to know the kind of evidence the authorities will be looking for. You always cover your tracks.</span></li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Feats</h4>
	<p class="reminder">Special actions that only you can perform.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Tail a suspect:</b><span> You know how to follow without being seen. By tailing someone you can learn their daily routine, place of work, and home. These details can prove useful in knowing where someone will (or won't) be in the future.</span></li>
		<li><b>Stake out:</b><span> Most dirty deeds happen at night. By staking out someone's home, you can see if they try anything ignoble (or maybe just learn something embarrassing about them). Best with two people, and don't forget the snacks.</span></li>
		<li><b>Blackmail:</b><span> To blackmail someone, you must know one of their secrets <em>and</em> who they want to keep it a secret from. Then, in a private conversation, you need to threaten to reveal what you know. With enough dirt, they'll do anything.</span></li>

	<ul></ul>
	<h4>Feats</h4>
	<p class="reminder">Special actions that only you can perform.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Sense Disposition:</b><span> You are an uncannily accurate judge of character, and can tell at a glance if someone is particularly gullible, vulnerable, upset, or attracted to someone.</span></li>
		<li><b>Charm:</b><span> In social situations, if you can share some fact or story about yourself that your speaking partner has in common or finds relatable, they'll be more likely to share information or do you small favors. The more details you know about them, the easier it is for you to find (or make you're no stranger to lying) something in common.</span></li>
		<li><b>Seduce:</b><span> If someone seems attracted to you, you can distract them with some light flirting. If you hit it off, you can even ask to head back to their place (or maybe somewhere nearby), which is an ideal opportunity to catch them in a vulnerable position.</span></li>
		<li><b>Pickpocket:</b><span> If someone's distracted or inattentive it's easy for you to relieve them of their wallet, keys, phone, or any other loose item. These can be useful on their own, but returning an item they "dropped" can also be a great way of getting on their good side.</span></li>

	<ul></ul>
	<h4>Feats</h4>
	<p class="reminder">Special actions that only you can perform.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Escalate:</b><span> If you find yourself in a tense situation, you can either taunt the opposing party into making the first move OR pacify them with threats of extreme retaliation. It's your choice... which may end up meaning more violence than not.</span></li>
		<li><b>Kidnap:</b><span> It's not your favorite activity, but you can stuff someone into a car if need be. The best results come from choosing a location with little security, driving up next to the target, and requesting they get into the car. Works best with two people and a gun.</span></li>
		<li><b>Interrogate:</b><span> If you're in a secured location with someone who's vulnerable, you can interrogate them. In your experience, almost everyone tells you what you want to know without you having to hurt them. Slowly revealing a variety of devilish tools is enough.</span></li>
		<li><b>Threaten:</b><span> Most people will call the authorities if you let them go after kidnapping / interrogating / harming them... that is, unless you give them reason not to. A thinly-veiled reminder of the consequences is enough to keep most from ratting you out.</span></li>

	<h4>Feats</h4>
	<p class="reminder">Special actions that only you can perform.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Sense Security:</b><span> After years of evading the authority, you have an eye for spotting security cameras and security personnel even when they're off-duty.</span></li>
		<li><b>Lockpick:</b><span> A lifetime of breaking and entering has left you with the skills to pick any lock that isn't keycard-operated or a vault. You know from personal experience that best results come from having a second person as a lookout, otherwise you arouse suspicion.</span></li>
		<li><b>Carjack:</b><span> Having run some carjacking operations yourself, you know how to break into and hotwire any vehicle. Again, best results come from having a lookout.</span></li>
		<li><b>Bribe:</b><span> You have a good sense of who's open to earning a little extra cash. If you'd like someone to forget what they saw, take a lunch break, or walk the other way, you know how to pass them a couple bills. Some do-gooders won't be receptive, however.</span></li>
